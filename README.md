# Exelius Engine - A Simple Multiplatform 2D Game Engine
Exelius written primarily with C++, as part of the Academy of Art GAP program.

This is the second version of the Engine that was written as a part of GAP 301 (Game Engine Programming).
The primary goal for this engine is to be educational, but there are a series of minor goals that will be attempted to be met as part of this 3 semester long project.
  - Platform Agnosticism
  - Strong Fundamentals — allow for further development with ease.
